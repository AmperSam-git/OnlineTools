    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>In GM standard MIDI files, channel 10 is reserved for percussion instruments only. Notes recorded on channel 10 always produce percussion sounds when transmitted to a keyboard or synth module which uses the GM standard. (via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_MIDI">WikiPedia</a>)</p>
    <p>However, the sound driver of AddMusicK / AddMusicM do not have such feature. If you convert a song from MIDI, you have to define different instrument and other channel values to make it work.</p>
    <p>I wrote this mini tool to solve such issues. It scans all of notes in various pitch, then replace with fitting labels. Now, it can be dealed quickly.</p>
    <h2>Notice</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>A channel of percussion MML just converted from a MIDI should be inputed.</li>
    <li><strong>Be aware this tool DO NOT deal with comments and other commands!</strong></li>
    </ul>
